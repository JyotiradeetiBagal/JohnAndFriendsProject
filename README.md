**Employee Management Operations Using JavaScript**
This project demonstrates various JavaScript array manipulation techniques through the implementation of employee management functionalities. The operations are designed to showcase the use of functions like .map(), .forEach(), .filter(), and .concat() for filtering, modifying, and managing data effectively.

**Features**

Part 1: Print Developer by Map
Functionality: Filters and logs developer objects using the .map() function.
Highlights:
Demonstrates proper usage of .map() for transformation and filtering.
Outputs the filtered objects via console.log().

Part 2: Print Developer by ForEach
Functionality: Filters and logs developer objects using the .forEach() function.
Highlights:
Utilizes .forEach() for iteration.
Logs filtered objects appropriately using console.log().

Part 3: Add Data
Functionality: Adds new employee objects to an existing array.
Highlights:
Ensures correct formatting of employee objects.
Logs the updated array to verify successful addition.

Part 4: Remove Admin
Functionality: Removes admin-level objects from the array using the .filter() function.
Highlights:
Accurately filters out admin objects.
Ensures clean and concise data handling.

Part 5: Concatenate Array
Functionality: Merges a new array containing three employee objects with the existing array using .concat().
Highlights:
Demonstrates efficient array concatenation.
Logs the combined array for validation.
